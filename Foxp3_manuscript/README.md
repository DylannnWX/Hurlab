Welcome to our Hur lab Foxp3 paper's repository! Here you'll find the custom scripts with descriptions, sample inputs & expected outputs, as well as demo runs for our Foxp3 manuscript. All of them are written in Jupyter Notebook. To install Jupyter Notebook, please refer to their official website:

https://jupyter.org/install

As these scripts runs on Python, you'll be able to use them on any platform (windows, mac, linux) as long as you have a python environment. There are three folders here with distinct purposes:

1. Deeptools_matrix_processing


   
2. FIMO_to_bed
3. HiC_Cool
