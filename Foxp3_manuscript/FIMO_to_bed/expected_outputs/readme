Here are the expected outputs by running the Jupyter Notebook with the three sample input files included (make sure you've put them in the same local folder).

These bed files are compatible with all other softwares that take bed files as inputs. 

For instance, if you'd like to merge the overlappign Fimo regions, you can then use bedtools merge function (https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/merge.html):

1. Sort the file by Chr and start location as required by bedtools merge:
sort -k1,1 -k2,2n Human_Fimo_allTnG.bed > Human_Fimo_allTnG_sorted.bed

2. Merge them into a new bed file, which can be opened in excel for downstream analysis:
bedtools merge -i Human_Fimo_allTnG_sorted.bed > Human_Fimo_merged_sorted.bed
