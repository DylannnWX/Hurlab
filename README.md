# Hurlab
Welcome to the Hurlab page by Dylan (Xi Wang)! Here you will find the customized scripts for Hur lab data analysis, manuscripts, and many others. 
Most of these scripts will be operating in standard Jupyter Notebook, and most of them are standalone instances with readme files, sample input & expected output, and demo runs.
Have fun!
